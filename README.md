Most of the code are derived from Ubercart 2CO Payment module.
All my code changes are Licenced under GNU/GPL.

INSTALLATION:
Put the uc_iyzipay module under /modules/ubercart/payment/ directory
Put the iyzico libraries under /libraries directory

At the moment the only way to make this code work is in a hackish way.

USAGE:
Set your class with your existing API credidentials in necessary files 

TODO:
1) Automation between configuration screen and API Credidentials
2) Full Integration of the payment page
3) Full Integration of the checkout page
